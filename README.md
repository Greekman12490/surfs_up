# Surfs_Up
## Overview
### W.Avy liked the analytical work that was related to Hawaii's temperatures. However, since he wants to open up a surf shop in Oahu. He wants us to be more specfic with our data. Specifically for the months of June and December. The following shall help me make a decision before opening his shop.
## Results
### When we look at June's temperature, we will see that the average is around seventy-five degrees fahrenheit (75°F). While the lowest temperature is sixty-four degrees fahrenheit (64°F) and the highest being eighty-five degrees fahrenheit (85°F). Now, when we look at December's temperature, we will see that the average is around seventy-one degrees fahrenheit (71°F). The lowest temperature being fifty-six degrees fahrenheit (56°F) and the highest being eighty-three degress fahrenheit (83°F). We can make several assumptions from this data. One, we can assume the degree measurement is in fahrenheit given that the United States of America uses the imperial system. Two, if it were to be metric, the state of Hawaii would be inhospitable to live. Three, we notice that the temperatures are lower in December than that of June. This assumption entails several things as well. One, given Hawaii is in the northern hemipshere, June is a summer month and December is a winter month. This would be the opposite if it were in the southern hemisphere.
