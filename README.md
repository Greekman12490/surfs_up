# Surfs_Up
## Overview
### W.Avy liked the analytical work that was related to Hawaii's temperatures. However, since he wants to open up a surf shop in Oahu. He wants us to be more specfic with our data. Specifically for the months of June and December. The following shall help me make a decision before opening his shop.
## Results
### June's Temperature
* Average - Seventy-five degrees fahrenheit (75°F)
* Lowest - Sixty-four degrees fahrenheit (64°F)
* Highest - Eighty-five degrees fahrenheit (85°F)

### December's Temperature
* Average - Seventy-one degrees fahrenheit (71°F)
* Lowest - Fifty-six degrees fahrenheit (56°F)
* Highest - Eighty-three degrees fahrenheit (83°F)

## Summary 
### We can make several assumptions from this data. One, we can assume the degree measurement is in fahrenheit given that the United States of America uses the imperial system. Two, if it were to be metric, the state of Hawaii would be inhospitable to live. Three, we notice that the temperatures are lower in December than that of June. This assumption entails several things as well. One, given Hawaii is in the northern hemipshere, June is a summer month and December is a winter month. This would be the opposite if it were in the southern hemisphere. 
### Now, we can also figure out how much precipation the months of June and December had. (again, the measurements that will be used is within the imperial system (inches))

### June's Precipitation
* Average - 0.13 inches
* Lowest - 0.00 inches
* Highest - 4.43 inches

### December's Precipitation
* Average - 0.22 inches
* Lowest - 0.00 inches
* Highest - 6.42 inches

![Dec_rain](https://github.com/Greekman12490/surfs_up/blob/main/Resources/December_prec_stats.png?raw=true)

### From this data above, we can make the assumption that June is drier than that of December.
